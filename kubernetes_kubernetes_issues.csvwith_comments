But I have a few questions about the design:
- Using `HealthCheckIP` to solve health check problem for isolated network may result in another problem: Pods in isolated network could connect each other by HealthCheckIP. Is this expected?
- If a container is configured with multiple interfaces, how could kubelet determine which interface is for health check?

For health check problem for isolated network, I suggest we could solve it another way:

We could embed essential http check utilities (e.g. curl) in pod infrastructure container, and do http checking by exec http check utilities in the pod infrastructure container. This method do not suppose connections between containers and host.

This has been discussed many times (including when the original namespaces feature was designed and implemented). Until now, it has not been accepted as a direction because of the internal and external complexity it would introduce, and because many use cases can also be satisfied by the flat namespace design, albeit less conveniently (like your teama-infrastructure and teama-services example). It's also difficult to see how this could be added in a way that would remain compatible with existing API clients"	5	feature

I think I'd rather encourage composition of commands (pipe) than every generator command in the system creating objects.  We may also want to clarify dry-run against the server vs dry run against the client - there are lots of places where we want to generate locally to a file or an editor or a pipe command before we want to create it.  

At this point, OpenShift has a few commands that treat -o \* as ""dry-run"" - new-app (complex generator) and export (never expect to send it to the server).  We also have a few that are designed to be compositional in a pipe _always_ - process (take a template and turn it into a list of api objects), which never creates the objects for you (you have to pipe to `create -f -`).

I'm somewhat partial to having  `kubectl expose` and `kubectl run` support the presence of `-o` changing the default of `dry-run` to true, because that's more common and easier than having to set `--dry-run=true` and `-o yaml`.  The counter argument is that `--dry-run` is the preferred action, and `-o` is format only - except that by definition --dry-run using the default output format isn't very useful (you created a service named foo and an rc named bar).  

My gut is that most users once they understand what a particular generator does their default path is always going to be `-o yaml --dry-run=true` to review the change, and then if they want to create it they can pipe to `kubectl reconcile -f -` or `kubectl create -f -` just by appending to their existing command.  I'm not sure that's a strong enough argument to couple --dry-run and -o, but based on our experience so far it's going to be the ""normal"" path.

72378	msau42	pohly	CONTRIBUTOR	2018-12-27 20:46:45	2018-12-28 15:02:24	2019-01-03 23:51:45	2019-01-03 23:51:45	PD multizone tests are flaky	"The PR broke the subpath test because the modification to the config struct embedded in the driver info now persists across tests:
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/a9c7dfba51a36959ccab0301c868bf622bad11d2/test/e2e/storage/drivers/in_tree.go#L1250-L1255

A quick fix would be to reset that field in CreateDriver. The long-term fix is the change discussed in https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/72288

My preference is to do the quick fix now, then either merge or close PRs in this order:
* https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/70992 (needs a decision about logging of tests that aren't getting defined, see https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/70992#discussion_r243769787)
* https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/72002
* a future PR for https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/72288

What I'd like to avoid is having to rebase PR #70992 on top of the long-term solution for issue #72288 - that'll be lots of code conflicts.

My preference would be to sweep calls the watch.Until/cache.ListWatchUntil and actually plumb the info needed to handle both the request timeout and the ""too old version"" errors. Do we know what changes would be needed to address both of those?

Looks like we have aboue 8 uses in non-test code, and about 15 in test code. That seems worth sweeping/fixing."	1	bug

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I understand the commands that are listed [here](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands).

While I am a bit unsure if it's necessary to invalidate `InterPodAntiAffinity` for every Pod add event. 

Here's the reason that I skipped its invalidation originally. Let's say:

1. pod_1 has AntiAffinity with any `app=nginx` Pod.
2. pod_1 is scheduled to Node X
3. pod_2 comes to scheduler after that, then we have two cases:
    1. pod_2 is equivalent to pod_1, ~~so it will just use ecache and bound to Node X, ecache is still valid.~~ [Update] If pod_2 & pod_1 are self anti-affinity, the ecache is invalid.
    2. pod_2 is not equivalent to pod1, then:
        1.  pod_2 is AntiAffinity against pod_1 (e.g. has` app=nginx` label), thus scheduler will reject it based on `InterPodAntiAffinity` rule, there will be no pod_2 add event for Node X. And no matter where pod_2 goes, ecache of that node is still valid.
       2. pod_2 is not AntiAffinity against pod_1 ( e.g. no` app=nginx` label), no matter where pod_2 goes, ecache of that node is still valid.

Thus, in my mind, as long as a non-equiv Pod which can break the cached AntiAffinity result will never be scheduled on that node, we don't need to do invalidation of it on pod add.

> Please feel free to correct me if I missed something here :D

As for the issue, it's actually caused by Pod A is considered as equivalent to itself during its re-scheduling. 

Of course invalidate `InterPodAntiAffinity` on Pod add can fix it, but then we will probably lose ecache boost for it since we need to do invalidation for ALL nodes in the same failure domain for every irrelevant Pod add.

I would prefer to fix this issue from another direction.

My idea is, for any Pod with assumed failure, we should bypass ecache as there's probably sth wrong, so I want to let the Pod run ""real"" predicates again as a retrying. In detail, I want to invalidate all predicates on that node for this equivalence class. 

The cons is we will lose ecache boost during this retry, but retry should not be a common case in my mind.

And the result of second round of predicate, if valid, will be cached again.

I think we need to test, in integration tests:
* CRD: one cluster scoped, one namespace scoped, with each having multiple versions -- we don't get additional certainty from testing additional CRDs. 
* One APIService of an extension apiserver that supports dry run, one that doesn't (is an old version)
* all built in types.
* one mutating and one validating webhook that support dry run, one each that don't.

We should test POST, PUT, PATCH.

It'd be OK to have an e2e test that verifies that exec, attach, proxy, portforward are all blocked by dry-run, since those things can't work in integration tests at all. That's the only use for an e2e test I can think of."	5

The only issue perhaps would be that maybe you wouldn't see what was already drawn on the screen, but as soon as we get around to implementing terminal resizing (which I'm working on), as soon as you attach, we'll force a screen refresh, so that shouldn't be an issue.

Should this be part of Service?  It was raised on the last call that this makes a lot of sense outside of Service in a more admin-owned way.  If we did that, it starts to look a LOT like Istio - a separation of Services and Policies.  I think Istio is a great thing, and will (eventually) be the basis for a lot of higher-level functionality, but I am sensitive to the idea that it may be premature.

That said, if Istio is the likely better answer, should we extend core Services in this way, knowing that it sort of overrides things that properly belong in something like Istio?  Or should we try to converge with Istio concepts in a way that we can extend into Istio later?  But Istio can't become required...

The ""omitempty"" option specific the field should be omited from the encoding if the field has an empty value, defined as false, zero, nil pointer and any array, string, slice, map.

If I understandy correctly, you want to check if statefulset is ready. I suggest you use the following

```
statfulset.spec.replicas == statefulset.status.replicas && statefulset.status.replicas == statefulset.status.readyreplicas && statfulset.status.currentcontrollerrevision == statefulset.status.updatecontrollerrevision

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I understand the commands that are listed [here](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands).

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I understand the commands that are listed [here](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands).

For some reason, kubelet thinks the spec of the mirror pod does not match the static pod locally. It then decides to delete the mirror pod and recreate it, repeatedly. As a result of that, it slows down (due to the QPS limit?) reporting statuses of other pods. This can be reproduced by running the e2e ""Shell"" test. I am looking into why the specs would suddenly mismatch. Did any recent PR modified the pod spec in apiserver?

>After the recent `test/e2e/storage` refactoring (merged for 1.13), a lot of tests get defined that can only run with specific cluster providers. Those tests then get skipped at runtime. Even tests that get skipped take time (test setup, creating client set or worse, deploying the driver if the driver needs that) and the list of skipped tests in the CI grew a lot without adding any information (skip reason not captured). Therefore this PR:
>- enables the definition of tests depending on the test context
>- changes the ""skip test"" API so that test definition gets skipped, while still allowing runtime skipping
>- changes the CSI and in-tree drivers to skip definition as much as possible
>
>**Special notes for your reviewer**:

>This contains PR #70862 because of code conflicts, so that PR must be merged first.

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I understand the commands that are listed [here](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands).

>**What this PR does / why we need it**: Adds CSI e2e tests for topology, using the GCE PD driver.
>
>**Which issue(s) this PR fixes** *(optional, in `fixes #<issue number>(, fixes #<issue_number>, ...)` format, will close the issue(s) when PR gets merged)*:
>Fixes #69703
>
>**Special notes for your reviewer**:
>* Since the `CSINodeInfo` object has a breaking change, these e2e tests now depend on external-provisioner and external-attacher versions 0.5.x and later. Version 0.4 uses the old CSINodeInfo object. As a result these tests will fail until 0.5 is released. Also, since external-provisioner 0.5 enables Topology by default, there's no need to explicitly set the Topology feature gate in these e2e tests.
>* Given time constraints I've deferred fully integrating with the storage e2e testing framework for now.
>* Currently these tests fail, but I verified the tests pass without the `CSINodeInfo` change and before rebasing with the new e2e framework. Currently working on verifying them with the e2e framework change.
>* Since Topology will be enabled on external-provisioner by default, in CSI provisioning tests it's no longer necessary if the GCE PD driver is multi-zone.
>
>**Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?**: No

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line.

>**What happened**:
>So, I ran some jobs `(single replica, no restart)`. Technically if I have 10 jobs on cluster, I should've `10 pods (running, completed, failed, pending)` or in any other state. 2 days Ago I had `900 jobs` and obviously `900 pods`. Today when I ran the command, `kubectl get pods -a` I only see `400 pods` but there are `900 jobs`. What can be the possible cause? 
>
>**What you expected to happen**:
>Missing Pods should've shown in the kuberentes
>
>**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:
>Run more and more jobs again and leave them for a day or two.
>
>**Environment**:
>- Kubernetes version (use `kubectl version`): v1.10.6
>- Cloud provider or hardware configuration: Azure (AKS)

@mborsz suspects that this is due to his change in kubelet log-level from v2 to v4. Once he confirms that's the case, we can:

- switch the job back to v2 (which also matches production default)
- try to understand why v4 is affecting that much and if that can be improved"	5

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I understand the commands that are listed [here](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands?repo=kubernetes%2Fkubernetes).

There are a few reasons why I think we should allow annotations to be updated:
1. To allow an extended controller to record extra information. For example, /binding is able to update annotations so that a custom scheduler can add external references.
2. To allow a controller to record information about what it did. For instance, /rollback updates an annotation that records the reason for the last change.
3. If we add fields to status of a new API version that are recorded as annotations in the storage version, then the controller may need to be able to write those annotations during a cluster upgrade.

If I've reading this code correctly, we've just doubled the number of times we're caching resources and not created the capital to make this easy in general.

With a dynamic shared informer factory, it becomes possible wire the ""get informer for resource"" to delegate across multiple candidates as we do in openshift.

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

Why is the alternative better? The pod that triggered preemption still goes to the back of the queue, while some running pods get terminated. The resources freed up for the pending pod would still go unused while the scheduler works through the queue of equal-priority pods.

That is, unless the queue has a feature to jump a pending pod to the front of the queue when it's nominated resources become free?"	5	bug

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I understand the commands that are listed [here](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands?repo=kubernetes%2Fkubernetes).

Explicit specification allows us to version them over time, whereas implicit injection creates an infinite API (we can never safely remove the feature).

For this reason I don't think we would ever have any plans to do this automatically without explicit action in the pod spec.  However, at some point it is likely that a container identity would be present in the container (in much the same way as the service account token), so you may be able to use that to accomplish the same goal.  

You can also write a pod preset that automatically injects envFrom values - @pmorie does pod preset support envFrom?"	2	feature

>We can now remove client impersonation from ClusterRole creation in tests since in `1.12` it is no longer required to work around https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/43409#issuecomment-287912190. Since `1.14` tests do not need to support being run with clients `<1.12` we can now safely remove this client impersonation code.
>
>Along with the change made here: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/70582 this
>Fixes: #62237
>
>/kind cleanup
>/assign @pohly @liggitt

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

I wrote them like this because I was concerned with the potential bootstrapping deadlocks: a webhook that enacts policies for cluster-scoped resources might cause bootstrapping deadlocks for the cluster or for its own deployment.

Thinking out loud, perhaps for cluster-scoped resources, the apiserver should only call the webhooks if the resources' labels match the [webhookConfig.namespaceSelector](https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/master/admissionregistration/v1beta1/types.go#L191), so that the critical bootstrapping resources can be excluded from the webhooks, thus breaking the bootstrapping deadlocks. This aligns with what we do for `namespaces` (see [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/master/admissionregistration/v1beta1/types.go#L149)). The downside is that the field name ""namespaceSelector"" becomes inappropriate.

To be clear I'm joining a non kubernetes network and a k8s network such that everyone can see everyone else - you can hit pods from the remote network and the k8s network can hit the remote computers

This would work fine with multiple k8s locations if you set up a different pod CIDR between the two. 

The only thing I can't get working is service routing which I made an issue about.

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

I understand the commands that are listed [here](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands).

Can you provide more details on your setup (Kubernetes version, autoscaler version, cloud provider, deployment config)?
One thing that comes to my mind is if you're using pod antiaffinity, there is a known issue where it interferes with CA logic calculating number of nodes to add.

By the way Cluster Autoscaler does not work by calculating resources at all, because there are many other scheduling constraints than just resources (ex. taints, nodeSelectors, node affinity, pod (anti)affinity, storage availability, ...). It uses a binpacking algorithm based on imported scheduler code. This is just an approximation algorithm, but it normally doesn't overshoot."	5

The goal is not to spell ""ext4"" anywhere in Kubernetes.  Just as we want to
never spell ""google"" or ""amazon"" and move all of that out of core, we
should endeavour to reduce hard deps on linuxisms, especially ones that
change vogue over time or across sites.

E.g. `func (mounter *SafeFormatAndMount) formatAndMount` should not
hardcode ext4 and flags for it, but should either exec something from the
node itself, or should receive params (e.g. kubelet config params) that
specify which FS and flags to use by default, or maybe even more flexibly
which FSes are allowed, which FS is default, and a map of per-fs flags to
use for mkfs and mount.

Then we can delete hardcoded ""ext4"" stuff and move it to configs, where it
can be changed more readily."	5	feature

- Keep recursive scanning as is, to avoid disruption
- When a directory event shows up, determined if it is mounted as a data dir using the mounter package (i.e. `mounter.IsLikelyNotMountPoint(...)`)

While the above will reject more DIRs and avoid scanning them, another suggestion would be to start scanning at a DIR dir one level below the Kubelet dir (i.e. `$KUBELET_DIR/plugreg/`).  This would avoid all false positives caused by scanning the existing in-tree volume plugins DIR at `KUBELET_DIR/plugin`.  This would require existing Kubelet Plugin to update where they place their socket file 😬 .

Thoughts ?

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I understand the commands that are listed [here](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands).

Getting new CRD's `category` via kubectl seems fixed but I'm afraid it's still not working for `short name`. Because that `shortcutExpander` doesn't have fresh logic on expanding failure. I believe it will work for short names too if `shortcutExpander` could fresh itself. 😃

```

Workaround:

To fix the system, we must delete the metrics-server:

```
kubectl -n=kube-system delete apiservice v1beta1.metrics.k8s.io
```

Now kubernetes will start normally.  After that we can reinstall the metrics server, and it will be ok.

It seems to be an issue like subshell inheritance. Only when running a command directly from the plugin.yaml file (i.e., echo $PWD) does it return the user's directory. Once the plugin.yml launches the script/binary, then the user's current environment is lost.

Without access to this, the plugin feature becomes unsuitable for many (if not all) of our use cases."	5	feature

What are the reasons you can't use a Pod? Job with exactly once semantics seems like a Pod to me.

Also note that the exactly once semantic is not enforceable unless you accept that you can be blocked indefinitely when the node goes down or network splits. Or you timeout, making the exactly once guarantee best effort only.

(You can't delete the Pod if the node is down/split, otherwise the container could just be running anyways.)"	5	feature

Instead of building the namespace selection logic inside the controllers (and thus probably hardcoding it), maybe we can have a `namespaceSelector` in the `InitializerConfiguration.Initializers`?

Has this been discussed before? I looked at the proposal at https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/admission_control_extension.md and https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/f929dac3046c3a75652b3731c4ab88ce1912e39b/contributors/design-proposals/dynamic-admission-control-configuration.md but I can't find a discussion about namespace selection for initializers."	4	feature

+1. Agree. With `fieldSelector`, this will be quite concise. Currently, `metadata.initializers` is not supported yet. We may need to add it."	1	bug

Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work.

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

In https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/65552#issuecomment-413232259, you suggested an approach to check for podTerminationGracePeriod.  I believe this grace period only determines the time period when kubelet should start force killing containers, and has the same issue that volumes may still be mounted at this time.

How about following a similar approach as attach/detach controller, and using the same force detach grace period (which is 5 minutes)?

@verult has also been brainstorming ideas on how to handle this node/kubelet down scenario to actually force delete Pods.

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I understand the commands that are listed [here](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands?repo=kubernetes%2Fkubernetes).

The `cri_stats_provider.go` code seems like it might benefit from a higher abstraction, since it's now weaving between the Linux-only cadvisor calls and the Windows-only `listContainerNetworkStats` call, but I'm not sure that needs to happen now.	5	bug

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I understand the commands that are listed [here](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands?repo=kubernetes%2Fkubernetes).

By ephemeral I mean volumes who have their lifecycle directly tied to the consuming pod.

We've been looking for someone to try and implement such a volume and help us discover the gaps, so thanks for doing that.

To summarize, it sounds like you ran in to the following blockers:

1. P0 - CSI does not pass CO workload information to plugin (specifically the pod's name, namespace, and UID).
2. P1 - Ability to run node only volume plugins (no attach required) without a no-op external-attacher.
3. P2 - Provide documentation and/or libraries for writing ephemeral volumes.

We plan to close (at least) the P0 and P1 items before CSI will GA. We can use this bug as a tracking bug."	5	api-change

Interesting lines are the three last ones.  At 19:04:54.753184 the second container was started and then kublet wants to report pod as started in the api server. In order to do so it issues GET and then PATCH, but the GET takes over 4s. 

Below are **api server logs** around that time, as you can see all operations have latency ~4s.

I checked few other pods with worst e2e latency in run 294 and all of them were more or less the same (pod was started in a timely manner, but it took super long to report it to the api server).

I also checked other runs and similar situation happens in all of the recent failures. E.g. run **296** (the most recent one), pod: **density-latency-pod-1325-dcjbg**

```
Get pod also took over 4s. 

Focusing back on run 294, we checked the [etcd logs](https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-jenkins/logs/ci-kubernetes-e2e-gce-scale-performance/294/artifacts/gce-scale-cluster-master/etcd.log) around the time the api server slowness occurred, but nothing interesting was found there. 
What's more in the api server we log the trace information if an etcd operation takes too long. In case of Get we log trace if an operation takes longer than 500ms (see [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/3ed107ff0e23c0ca434865b1a3608be21b11601f/staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/endpoints/handlers/get.go#L52)), but no trace was found in the apiserver log for any of the slow operations. It means that we can exclude etcd as a culprit here. The slowness seems to be coming from the api server itself. I'll examine the pprof files we collect for the api-server to see if there is anything interesting there.

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I understand the commands that are listed [here](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands?repo=kubernetes%2Fkubernetes).

Both external and custom metrics API work by treating metrics as pseudo-resources. The rules that apply to naming are the result of what Kubernetes apimachinery allows for resources. If resource names are not case sensitive I don't think there is anything we can do about it.

@kubernetes/sig-api-machinery-feature-requests Can you advise on this?

If the metric name can't be used directly it's up to adapter to come up with a scheme to escape it. For example Stackdriver adapter has a similar problem - slashes are not allowed as part of metric name in external metrics API, but they're used in SD metric names. SD adapter deals with it by replacing slashes with pipes ('|') in metric names."	5	bug,feature

As a result the metrics don't get exposed on `/metrics` endpoint.

>This PR adds log for the errors and fixes some of the invalid CRD metric names. The name change should be backwards compatible since the metrics were never exposed.

>**Special notes for your reviewer**:
>Alternatively we could panic on the errors. However, there are errors caused by duplication (see the [gist](https://gist.github.com/roycaihw/1bbb77d38e198b2528651b660da6c9da) above) that I don't fully understand. Also there are [metrics](https://gist.github.com/roycaihw/57c95d70e00a169223e2f73cde2fee6d) with invalid name not triggering error in my local cluster. I didn't fix those metrics.

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

All HPA ever does is changed the desired number of replicas on deployment, it doesn't touch individual pods or care about where they're scheduled.

To address your original problem though:
1. Cluster Autoscaler can move a deployment with 1 replica if it thinks it will help scale-down (unless you have a PDB that doesn't allow it).
2. There are multiple reasons why CA may not remove a node. The most common scenario in small clusters is system pods being scheduled on scaled-up node. You can find more details about possible reasons why CA is not scaling down and how to solve then in CA FAQ: https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#i-have-a-couple-of-nodes-with-low-utilization-but-they-are-not-scaled-down-why."	5

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line.

In response to [this](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/68955):

>**PLEASE COORDINATE WITH SIG-SCHEDULING BEFORE WORKING ON THIS ISSUE.** We want to avoid the situation where two people accidentally start work on the same fix.
>Main tracking issue: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/68951
>
>A lot of the behavior of `genericScheduler` is captured inside the informer event handlers in `pkg/scheduler/factory/factory.go`. Our code will be easier to maintain if the behavior of `genericScheduler` is not spread across different packages, so we should move all informer event handlers to be methods of `genericScheduler`.
>
>
>When these functions move, we should also fix their names to be consistent. Most of them are named like `onPvAdd` and there are a few that need to be updated to match this pattern.

"@NickrenREN Did you test this on a multi-node cluster? Keep in mind that Access Modes work on node level, so multiple pods on the same node can access an RWO volume: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#access-modes
I guess this is because volumes are mounted by nodes, not individual pods.

BTW, I don't understand why `AccessModes` in PVC is an array, because according to docs a PV can be mounted in only one access mode at the same time. I suspect it's an array because the volume provisioner copies this array to the PV spec, but IMHO it should rather create a single-item array from the single access mode defined in the PVC spec.

In response to [this](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/61132):

>/kind bug
>@kubernetes/sig-gcp-bugs
>
>**What happened**:
>I created a GKE cluster using the GKE REST API (https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/reference/rest/) and within it a nodepool that was supposed to have a Taint on all nodes in the pool. Instead the only taints present were:
>
>`Taints:             nvidia.com/gpu=present:NoSchedule`
>
>**What you expected to happen**:
>I expected the taint defined in the request to also be added to the node.
>
>**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:
>Create a node pool using GKE REST API and specify the nodepool with config to add taint. Eg nodepool config:
>
>
>```
>   {'name': 'nodepool'
>     'initialNodeCount': 0,

```
$ kubectl wait --for condition=ready pod

Yet when you try to use it, it declares `unknown flag: --all`

Would really like the wait functionality given some much needed TLC. Still no way to determine what conditions are supported for various resources (eg. I can say `--for condition=potato` and it just waits for the timeout like that resource might actually potato at some point).

1. mentioning a sig: `@kubernetes/sig-<group-name>-<group-suffix>`
    e.g., `@kubernetes/sig-contributor-experience-<group-suffix>` to notify the contributor experience sig, OR

2. specifying the label manually: `/sig <group-name>`
    e.g., `/sig scalability` to apply the `sig/scalability` label

Note: Method 1 will trigger an email to the group. See the [group list](https://git.k8s.io/community/sig-list.md).
The `<group-suffix>` in method 1 has to be replaced with one of these: _**bugs, feature-requests, pr-reviews, test-failures, proposals**_.

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I understand the commands that are listed [here](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands?repo=kubernetes%2Fkubernetes).

I think this has to do with a couple things. 

1. kube-proxy redirects traffic destined for external lb ips to the cluster ip. 
2. Misconfigured CNI results in pods being unable to curl the service the pod itself belongs to. You can read about that here and how to fix it. https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/20475

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

Changing metrics this way with no advance notice is likely to cause problems with monitoring over upgrade boundaries.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I understand the commands that are listed [here](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands?repo=kubernetes%2Fkubernetes).

@kubernetes/sig-node-feature-requests


<details>

In response to [this](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/62038):

>Windows Service Accounts in Kubernetes
>======================================
>
>**Authors**: Patrick Lang ([@patricklang](https://www.github.com/patricklang)), Ryan Puffer ([@rpsqrd](https://www.github.com/rpsqrd))
>**Reviewers**: Peter Hornyack, more welcome!
>*What is Active Directory?*
>
>Windows applications and services typically use Active Directory identities to facilitate authentication and authorization between resources. In a traditional virtual machine scenario, the computer is joined to an Active Directory domain which enables it to use Kerberos, NTLM, and LDAP to identify and query for information about other resources in the domain. 
>
>*What is a service account?*
>
>A Group Managed Service Account (gMSA) is a shared Active Directory identity that enables common scenarios such as authenticating and authorizing incoming requests and accessing downstream resources such as a database server, file share, or other workload.
>
>*How is it applied to containers?*
>
>To achieve the scale and speed required for containers, Windows uses a group managed service account in lieu of individual computer accounts to enable Windows containers to communicate with Active Directory. As of right now, Windows cannot use individual Active Directory computer & user accounts.
>
>Different containers on the same machine can use different gMSAs to represent the specific workload they are hosting, allowing operators to granularly control which resources a container has access to. However, to run a container with a gMSA identity, an additional parameter must be supplied to the Windows Host Compute Service to indicate the intended identity. This proposal seeks to add support in Kubernetes for this parameter to enable Windows containers to communicate with other enterprise resources.
>
>It's also worth noting that Docker implements this in a different way that's not managed centrally. It requires dropping a file on the node and referencing it by name, eg: `docker run --credential-spec='file://foo.json'` . For more details see the Microsoft [doc](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/Virtualization-Documentation/blob/live/windows-server-container-tools/ServiceAccounts/README.md#running-containers).
>
>
>## Parts of solution
>
>### Provisioning Workflow
>
>This is a workflow that's handled outside of Kubernetes until the last step. Most organizations have tight control over who can create Active Directory accounts, and the role is usually separated from that of an application owner. Performing these steps in Kubernetes is not a goal.
>
>1. An Active Directory domain administrator:
>    a. Joins all Windows nodes to the Active Directory domain.
>    b. Provisions the service account and gives details to application admin. 
>    c. Assigns access to a security group to control what machines can use this service account. This group should include all authorized Kubernetes nodes.
>2. The application admin uses a [script](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/Virtualization-Documentation/tree/live/windows-server-container-tools/ServiceAccounts) to verify the account exists, and capture enough data to uniquely identify it into a JSON file. This doesn't contain any passwords or crypto secrets.
>3. The application admin [stores](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#-em-secret-generic-em-) this JSON in the Kubernetes secret store with `kubectl create secret generic WindowsServiceAccount1 --from-file=credspec.json`
>
>Steps 2 and 3 could potentially be built into cluster management tools such as `kubeadm` at a later time for an easier cluster admin experience.
>
>Example credentialspec.json
>
>```json
>{
>  ""CmsPlugins"": [
>    ""ActiveDirectory""
>  ],
>  ""DomainJoinConfig"": {
>    ""DnsName"": ""contoso.com"",
>    ""Guid"": ""244818ae-87ca-4fcd-92ec-e79e5252348a"",
>    ""DnsTreeName"": ""contoso.com"",
>    ""NetBiosName"": ""DEMO"",
>    ""Sid"": ""S-1-5-21-2126729477-2524075714-3094792973"",
>    ""MachineAccountName"": ""WebApplication1""
>  },
>  ""ActiveDirectoryConfig"": {
>    ""GroupManagedServiceAccounts"": [
>      {
>        ""Name"": ""WebApplication1"",
>        ""Scope"": ""DEMO""
>      },
>      {
>        ""Name"": ""WebApplication1"",
>        ""Scope"": ""contoso.com""
>      }
>    ]
>  }
>}
>```
>
>Today this would typically be around 400-2000 characters of JSON, but could grow in the future if additional account types or configurations are added.
>
>### Deployment Workflow
>
>Deployment should be as simple as using a Kubernetes secret, but a different property will be used that's specific to Windows. This is optional, and would only be used in machines already joined to an Active Directory domain. It has no relation or dependency on  existing K8s service accounts because it cannot be used inside of containers/pods to access any resources. It's used on the node side by the Windows runtime only.
>
>There are two options proposed on how this could be done.
>
>**Option 1** - Make the new field `WindowsCredentialSpec` a reference to a k8s secret. This keeps the verbose credential spec out of the deployment which may be easier to manage and read. If multiple deployments need the same credential spec and it needs to be changed, it can be done in a single place by updating the k8s secret. _The rest of this document will assume the workflow for Option 1._

>No extra steps or configuration are needed in the kubelet config, and no additional daemon sets are required. The deployment should contain everything needed (except the contents of the secret) as its passed from the apiserver. The kubelet will automatically pull the contents of the credentialspec from the secret, which is the same flow used for in-tree volume plugins ([cephfs](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/a1437feb18c1b1cf319607cd36cfd2865fba3a5a/pkg/volume/cephfs/cephfs.go#L106

>1. Deployment request includes a container with WindowsCredentialSpec set to secret name
>
>2. The kubelet will retrieve the credentialspec JSON from the secret and set `windows.CredentialSpec` per the [OCI Runtime Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/master/config-windows.md#credential-spec)
>
>3. The CRI implementation will pass this to Windows as appropriate.
>
>   a. Dockershim will need to implement an intermediate step because Docker EE-basic 17.x builds available on Windows read credentialspecs from files. The dockershim will need to copy the contents of the credentialspec to a local file with a unique name under the folder `c:\programfiles\docker\credentialspecs` such as `d4d521e1-2933-4d59-9b8e-ebe51524a76e.json`. When the pod is destroyed, the file should be deleted by dockershim.

>
>* **Active Directory (AD)** - is a directory service built into Windows Server that provides identity and directory services using LDAP and enables the use of security protocols including Kerberos and X.509 public key infrastructure.
>* **CredentialSpec** . A JSON object that controls which Windows-specific accounts are available to the container. This could eventually be extended to include additional Windows-specific accounts or certificate stores. [Microsoft docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/manage-containers/manage-serviceaccounts)
>* **Group Managed Service Account** (gMSA) - are a type of Active Directory account that makes it easy to secure services without sharing a password. Multiple machines or containers share the same gMSA as needed to authenticate connections between services. When you create a gMSA, you can choose what other accounts (computers and/or users) are able to use it.

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I understand the commands that are listed [here](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands?repo=kubernetes%2Fkubernetes).

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I understand the commands that are listed [here](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands).

2. specifying the label manually: `/sig <group-name>`

That seems excessive to me, but if it's normal we should probably limit the concurrency of integration tests. If it's not normal, it seems like we are leaking goroutines.

Some examples of what those 8192 goroutines are doing:

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I understand the commands that are listed [here](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands?repo=kubernetes%2Fkubernetes).

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

```
Pod_1
Req = 1Gi
Limit = 1Gi
QoS = Guaranteed
oom_score_adj = -998
```
`Node Capacity = 10 Gi`
```
Pod_2
Req = 1Gi
Limit = 1.01Gi
QoS = Burstable
oom_score_adj = 1000 - (1000*1Gi) / 10Gi = 900
```

That is a pretty huge difference.

Given that we have priority, I think we should revisit the decision to set the `oom_score_adj` so low for Guaranteed pods.  I would prefer actually using the burstable formula for all pods except `system-node-critical` and `system-cluster-critical` priority pods.  This keeps the oom score the same for Burstable and BestEffort, but increases the oom_score_adj for Guaranteed pods to be in-line with a Burstable pod with the same requests.

Generally, this issue occurs because we differentiate between QoS tiers in a non-continuous way.  As mentioned at sig-node, using the guaranteed QoS tier requires setting CPU and memory limits, which isn't always desirable.  Just as eviction doesn't take limits into account, I don't think setting the `oom_score_adj` should either, as that ends up requiring setting limits just to achieve some notion of priority.

My ideal formula would be something like:
```
oomScoreAdjust := 1000 - (1000* memoryRequest)/memoryCapacity
if podIsCritical(pod) {
    oomScoreAdjust -= 999
}
return oomScoreAdjust
```

This way, critical pods are still differentiated by requests, and the only input variable from the pod is the pod's memory request."	1	bug

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I understand the commands that are listed [here](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands?repo=kubernetes%2Fkubernetes).

Hello @kad !

Thanks for opening this issue! In general I'm in favor of adding a `Deallocate` call.

We do need to discuss what is the expected behavior in case of a crash. i.e: Do we want at most once of at least once call of that.
Currently the Allocate call has at least once behavior so it would make sense to have this call be the same.

In terms of implementation, @jiayingz and @vishh might have more insights than me, but I was thinking of hooking into the Kuberuntime pre-stop hook, and maybe have a path at container start to handle reboot ?"	5	feature

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I understand the commands that are listed [here](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands?repo=kubernetes%2Fkubernetes).

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I understand the commands that are listed [here](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands?repo=kubernetes%2Fkubernetes).

One example is that with `NodePort` service in a 5000 node cluster, if I have 2000 services and each services have 10 pods, this will cause 20000 iptable records on each worker node, and this can make the kernel pretty busy. Using IPVS-based in-cluster service load balancing can help a lot for such case.	5	feature

Adding this feature there is quite easy, however we have more pressing issues right now. While this dynamic provisioning stabilizes, do you have more high-level use case for this? Is reclaim policy something that should be common to a group of PVCs (or even a site policy) or is it something that each PVC author decides individually for each PVC?

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I understand the commands that are listed [here](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands?repo=kubernetes%2Fkubernetes).

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I understand the commands that are listed [here](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands?repo=kubernetes%2Fkubernetes).

All new API groups (even new in-tree ones) are supposed to use qualified names. Additionally, the api guidelines state ""the Kubernetes project reserves use of the empty group, all single word names (""extensions"", ""apps""), and any group name ending in ""*.k8s.io"" for its sole use"". Disallowing single-segment groups via CRDs is done to ensure new single segment names aren't introduced via CRD. 

For your particular use case, I assume you would need to migrate existing data? If so, I think mixing CRD and non-CRD backed APIs in a single group is a bad idea.  Even if you manage to isolate the differently-backed types into their own versions, that will tie your hands in evolving those types into versions containing one of the differently-backed types.

The original design had two dynamic fields in `DriverInfo`, `Framework` and `Config`:
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/b89b367247039f4a46a1ca2f0e4e906d723d79d2/test/e2e/storage/drivers/base.go#L92-L96

There was an explicit call to set them at runtime.

I moved all of that into a single, new struct (`TestConfig`) and got rid of the explicit call, but that doesn't address the underlying problem: it is still not obvious when those fields are valid and when they need to be set resp. reset.

I don't think we can create `TestDriver` anew for each test, because which instance would do that? The testsuite code needs some parameter that describes the current driver, and that is what the `TestDriver` instance is.

What we can do is remove the dynamic parts from `DriverInfo`. I suspect it was done that way to avoid passing around two pointers (one for the static driver, one for the dynamic config), but I believe that's not going to be that bad.

So what do you think about this:
- remove `Config` from `DriverInfo`
- pass it by value to `TestDriver.CreateDriver`
- let `TestDriver.CreateDriver` return a new `RuntimeTestDriver` interface which contains:
  - a copy of the original `TestDriver`
  - a potentially modified copy of the config
  - a `CleanupDriver` method

Moving `CleanupDriver` into this new interface removes the ambiguity around whether the current method needs to be called after failures in `CreateDriver`. In the new approach, `CreateDriver` either succeeds or fails, and `CleanupDriver` only needs to be called after success.

But that new interface isn't strictly needed. We can also keep it as-is and just pass around a `TestDriver` interface and a `TestConfig` returned by `CreateDriver`. Might be simpler.

https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/ad403f8e2054d0dcd322e287af17cc3d69b38bf3/cmd/kubeadm/app/cmd/phases/join/controlplanejoin.go#L46

Removing `KubeConfigPath` function from the interface in the `controlPlaneJoinData` will allow the cast to happen, with the removal of `KubeConfigPath` on `join.go` as well (basically reverting this patch).

Then, all references on this phase need adapting and calling directly to `kubeadmconstants.GetAdminKubeConfigPath()` instead:

https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/ad403f8e2054d0dcd322e287af17cc3d69b38bf3/cmd/kubeadm/app/cmd/phases/join/controlplanejoin.go#L120

https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/ad403f8e2054d0dcd322e287af17cc3d69b38bf3/cmd/kubeadm/app/cmd/phases/join/controlplanejoin.go#L162

https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/ad403f8e2054d0dcd322e287af17cc3d69b38bf3/cmd/kubeadm/app/cmd/phases/join/controlplanejoin.go#L190

The problem was that `KubeConfigPath()` was removed from `join.go` but not adapted in `controlplanejoin.go` afterwards, so the cast fails because `joinData` does not implement the required `KubeConfigPath` function in the `controlPlaneJoinData` interface: all of them should be removed and use `kubeadmconstants.GetAdminKubeConfigPath()` instead.

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I understand the commands that are listed [here](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands?repo=kubernetes%2Fkubernetes).

I thought kubelet is supposed to delete the pod object only after the volumes are unmounted. This also impacts the StorageProtection feature, which assumes that if the Pod object is deleted, then the volume has been unmounted. For a storage backend like nfs, it may result in unmount hanging. cc @kubernetes/sig-storage-bugs  

@cofyc to fix the flakiness, the simplest thing may be to make the two pods use the same fsgroup.  I don't see a strong use case for two pods using different fsgroups."	5	bug,failing-test

>/kind cleanup
>
>**What this PR does / why we need it**:
>
>This is one of three PRs with the goal to remove some global state in the `csi` package.
>
>This PR introduces the following important changes:
>- global state in the `csi` package is removed (specifically: `csi.nim` & `csi.csiDrivers`); this state is moved onto the plugin struct
>- the map of registered csi drivers has been moved into its own struct which internally manages the mutex
>- the plugin implements the methods for both the `VolumePlugin` and the `PluginHandler` interfaces
>
>Right now the kubelet still expects a separate VolumePlugin and a Registration Handler. To allow for that, we make sure to only ever create one instance of the `csi.plugin` and have make sure the VolumePlugin & the RegistrationHandler use this singleton. This is implemented by using a `sync.Once` and on package global variable holding the singleton instance.
>**Note:** This singleton is only temporary and will go away with the last commit of this set, when the changes needed in the kubelet are figured out and merged.
>
>
>**Which issue(s) this PR fixes**:
>
>- Addresses parts of #69374
>- Supersedes https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/69462

>**Special notes for your reviewer**:

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I understand the commands that are listed [here](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands?repo=kubernetes%2Fkubernetes).

It seems like the first image (`gcr.io/kubernetes-e2e-test-images/serve-hostname:1.1`) that is being used in the test takes around 30-40 seconds to be terminated. The test consistently hits the 5 minute timeout on a 10 node cluster, given that rolling all the pods takes longer than 300 seconds.

The `serve-hostname` binary [sleeps for 60 seconds][0] after getting the SIGTERM signal, which I believe would cause the kubelet to force-kill the process after the default 30 second grace period. Not sure why that sleep is there.

A sig label can be added by either:

1. mentioning a sig: `@kubernetes/sig-<group-name>-<group-suffix>`
    e.g., `@kubernetes/sig-contributor-experience-<group-suffix>` to notify the contributor experience sig, OR

2. specifying the label manually: `/sig <group-name>`
    e.g., `/sig scalability` to apply the `sig/scalability` label

Note: Method 1 will trigger an email to the group. See the [group list](https://git.k8s.io/community/sig-list.md).
The `<group-suffix>` in method 1 has to be replaced with one of these: _**bugs, feature-requests, pr-reviews, test-failures, proposals**_

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work.

This also breaks the AWS cloud provider when using [private hosted DNS zones](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/hosted-zones-private.html).

Essentially, kubelet thinks the nodename is whatever the local hostname is (""ip-xx-xx-xx-xx-.my.custom.domain.com"") and then tries to get the instance details by querying the EC2 API by `private-dns-name`, which actually is something like ""ip-xx-xx-xx-xx.us-west-2.compute.internal""). This fails of course.

This makes it impossible to use the AWS cloud provider and therefore automatic ELB provisioning, etc.

A colleague who helped me with the analysis asked me to tell Microsoft that either I made the wrong configuration or it was a bug in HNS, but neither of them should stop the system at all. I agree with that, and I hope that this issue is addressed at a higher level by Microsoft.

```
In order to handle ""Receiving network data"" due to a network interruption in Windows, the NIC driver called NdisMIndicateReceiveNetBufferLists. This data is passed through vmswitch to vfpext.sys, and it is repeated calling vswitch - vfpext - vswitch - vfpext while calling VmsForwardNetBufferListsBySourcePortsAndNblChains.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/network/receiving-network-data

It has been repeatedly called, and it has exceeded the kernel stack (24k on 64-bit systems), resulting in a memory dump. Also, all of the dump files collected over multiple times have caused a memory dump for the same reason. (NDIS.SYS, VFPEXT.SYS)

https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ntdebugging/2008/02/01/kernel-stack-overflows/

As a result, Microsoft needs to find out why the vswitch - vfpext - vswitch - vfpext is being called repeatedly.
```

I attach a report file that my colleague analyzed with WinDbg.

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I understand the commands that are listed [here](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands?repo=kubernetes%2Fkubernetes).

NetworkPolicy tests are a `[Feature:]` and so don't get run by default. But I imagine at least some of the CI test environments implement NetworkPolicy (e2e-gce?) so probably we should fix that.

So 2 fixes:
- Make the tests pass again; probably requires changing the test image from busybox to something else. I bet there are other tests in #69571 that they switched from wget to curl where they did remember to change the image (because the tests would have failed otherwise) so this should just be a matter of seeing what image they used there, and use it here too.
- Make at least one of the CI tests test NetworkPolicy

There are a ton of ways to externalize configs for spring - can you use a properties file as a work around instead of environment variables?  It does look to me like spring's `SystemEnvironmentPropertyLoader` only attempts to resolve `.` to `_` in var names (https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/master/spring-core/src/main/java/org/springframework/core/env/SystemEnvironmentPropertySource.java)

Also, it does look like environ has some munging that will get around this for you:

> Note that Environ automatically lowercases keys, and replaces the characters ""_"" and ""."" with ""-"". The environment variable DATABASE_URL and the system property database.url are therefore both converted to the same keyword :database-url.

Does the environ support unstick you?  Seems like it would also probably be possible to write your own property source that does the resolution you want - this will likely be more portable than depending on the shell to support the values you want.

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

First of all, I was thinking about LimitRanges set per namespace, but the LimiRange types are: Pod, Container, PersistentVolumeClaim. The documentation says: ``If a Pod does not meet the constraints imposed by the LimitRange, it cannot be created in the namespace.``, which means that it doesn't fit the scenario described by your [2] point, as the LimitRange will be taken into account per Pod, not over all Pods in a Namespace.

So, the scenario described by [2] should be related to ResourceQuotas. In this regard, the test ``[sig-api-machinery] ResourceQuota should create a ResourceQuota and capture the life of a pod.`` already does what you need, plus a few extra things:

1. Creates a ResourceQuota and validates the ResourceQuota (should be empty).
2. Creates Pod that fits quota and validates the ResourceQuota updates accordingly.
3. Ensures that it cannot spawn a new pod which exceeds the quota (including with extended resources).
4. Ensures that it cannot update the original Pod's requested resources.
5. Ensures that the ResourceQuota did not change.
6. Deletes the pod and ensures that the ResourceQuota updates accordingly.

Other ResourceQuota related tests:


    [sig-api-machinery] ResourceQuota [Feature:PodPriority] should verify ResourceQuota's multiple priority class scope (quota set to pod count: 2) against 2 pods with same priority classes.
    [sig-api-machinery] ResourceQuota [Feature:PodPriority] should verify ResourceQuota's priority class scope (cpu, memory quota set) against a pod with same priority class.
    [sig-api-machinery] ResourceQuota [Feature:PodPriority] should verify ResourceQuota's priority class scope (quota set to pod count: 1) against 2 pods with different priority class.
    [sig-api-machinery] ResourceQuota [Feature:PodPriority] should verify ResourceQuota's priority class scope (quota set to pod count: 1) against 2 pods with same priority class.
    [sig-api-machinery] ResourceQuota [Feature:PodPriority] should verify ResourceQuota's priority class scope (quota set to pod count: 1) against a pod with different priority class (ScopeSelectorOpExists).
    [sig-api-machinery] ResourceQuota [Feature:PodPriority] should verify ResourceQuota's priority class scope (quota set to pod count: 1) against a pod with different priority class (ScopeSelectorOpNotIn).
    [sig-api-machinery] ResourceQuota [Feature:PodPriority] should verify ResourceQuota's priority class scope (quota set to pod count: 1) against a pod with same priority class.
    [sig-api-machinery] ResourceQuota [Feature:ScopeSelectors] should verify ResourceQuota with best effort scope using scope-selectors.
    [sig-api-machinery] ResourceQuota [Feature:ScopeSelectors] should verify ResourceQuota with terminating scopes through scope selectors.
    [sig-api-machinery] ResourceQuota should create a ResourceQuota and capture the life of a configMap.
    [sig-api-machinery] ResourceQuota should create a ResourceQuota and capture the life of a persistent volume claim with a storage class. [sig-storage]
    [sig-api-machinery] ResourceQuota should create a ResourceQuota and capture the life of a persistent volume claim. [sig-storage]
    [sig-api-machinery] ResourceQuota should create a ResourceQuota and capture the life of a pod.
    [sig-api-machinery] ResourceQuota should create a ResourceQuota and capture the life of a replica set.
    [sig-api-machinery] ResourceQuota should create a ResourceQuota and capture the life of a replication controller.
    [sig-api-machinery] ResourceQuota should create a ResourceQuota and capture the life of a secret.
    [sig-api-machinery] ResourceQuota should create a ResourceQuota and capture the life of a service.
    [sig-api-machinery] ResourceQuota should create a ResourceQuota and ensure its status is promptly calculated.
    [sig-api-machinery] ResourceQuota should verify ResourceQuota with best effort scope.
    [sig-api-machinery] ResourceQuota should verify ResourceQuota with terminating scopes.

Also, for behaviour [3], normally, it is not possible. If a new pod will exceed the set ResourceQuota, the Kubernetes API will error out instead, and no other pod is created:

    kubectl create -f pods/busybox_windows_pod_res.yaml -n test-rq
    Error from server (Forbidden): error when creating ""pods/busybox_windows_pod_res.yaml"": pods ""win-busybox2"" is forbidden: exceeded quota: mem-cpu-demo, requested: requests.cpu=1,requests.memory=1Gi, used: requests.cpu=1,requests.memory=1Gi, limited: requests.cpu=1,requests.memory=1Gi

One way [3] could work, would be when ``PodPriority`` and ``PodPremption`` features are being used. And for that, there are a few tests:

    [sig-scheduling] SchedulerPreemption [Serial] validates basic preemption works
    [sig-scheduling] SchedulerPreemption [Serial] validates lower priority pod preemption by critical pod
    [sig-scheduling] SchedulerPreemption [Serial] validates pod anti-affinity works in preemption

The mentioned tests are known to pass on Windows."	5	bug

What is the expected behavior we are testing for?  What does ""run something that will take up system ram"" mean?  Does that mean run a pod that uses up memory or run a system service that uses memory?

After setting the reserves `kubelet --system-reserved` and `--kube-reserved` as mentioned in [release notes for 1.13](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG-1.13.md#sig-windows-1) we should be able to schedule pods until full and then once we trigger OOM (either by pod or system service) kubelet should continue running becuase of the reserves?  

Do the two settings need to be tested independently or they should be tested together?  I found [this test](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/test/e2e_node/node_container_manager_test.go) that seems to be doing something similar but it is in node-e2e.  Is sig-windows running node-e2e tests currently?

I think the interface being an arg to e2e.test would be unpleasant to use...I need to checkout kubernetes & do `make WHAT=test/e2e/e2e.test`, probably building a bunch of unrelated stuff. And what if we someday want to add another args or deprecate one, the versioning of our arg ""interface"" will be difficult to communicate.

It doesn't mean we can't maintain both though.

Anyway I like very much the general idea of having a generic driver that simply takes yamls so that I don't have to write a TestDriver or any code at all unless I'm doing something complicated, it's exactly what I had in mind also."	1	feature

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I understand the commands that are listed [here](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands).

Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work.

according to the docker doc, that looks correct:

Eventually we would want to move to a reconciliation based plugin watcher eliminating the possibility of ""losing an API object forever"" because the update timed out: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/67972

For now maybe just tweaking the exponential backoff parameters is enough. It needs to be examined whether the plugin watcher is doing registration of plugins synchronously and we need to be careful not to block the thread for too long if it is. If it is asyncronous then we need to be cognizant of the issue where a plugin is removed *while* a goroutine is still trying to do the update for the objects addition."	5	failing-test

We are trying to consolidate the channels to which questions for help/support are posted so that we can improve our efficiency in responding to your requests, and to make it easier for you to find answers to frequently asked questions and how to address common use cases.

We regularly see messages posted in multiple forums, with the full response thread only in one place or, worse, spread across multiple forums. Also, the large volume of support issues on github is making it difficult for us to use issues to identify real bugs.

The Kubernetes team scans stackoverflow on a regular basis, and will try to ensure your questions don't go unanswered.

Before posting a new question, please search stackoverflow for answers to similar questions, and also familiarize yourself with:
- [the user guide](http://kubernetes.io/v1.0/)
- [the troubleshooting guide](http://kubernetes.io/v1.0/docs/troubleshooting.html)

Again, thanks for using Kubernetes.

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I understand the commands that are listed [here](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands?repo=kubernetes%2Fkubernetes).

Right now, applications solve this in different ways - for example, Spark has the [History Server](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/monitoring.html#viewing-after-the-fact) that takes in, persists and makes configuration of past jobs accessible. I think the presentation layer will differ because these applications represent history in ways specific to them.

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I understand the commands that are listed [here](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands?repo=kubernetes%2Fkubernetes).

Then let me come back to my question from
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/70319#issuecomment-436792272:
is there there ever a situation where there should be more than one
operation in flight *per volume*? Note that I meant ""should be"" as in
""should be allowed to be"".

@saad-ali answer was no, but in practice it was allowed because the
check was was based on volume + pod. That check has been shown to be
insufficient for one case. Can we be sure that this case (which gets
addressed with your PR) is the only one?

I genuinely don't know.

>
>This PR does 2 things (LMK if I should split into 2 separate PRs):
>
>1. Introduce a `?follow=true` query parameter for apiserver logs (e.g. `/logs/kube-apiserver.log?follow=true`) which holds the connection open until the client cancels it and continues to stream new log lines.
>2. Take advantage of this functionality to de-flake the advanced audit tests. To do so, start streaming the audit logs before running the test actions, and asynchronously watch for the expected events.

>**Which issue(s) this PR fixes**:
>Fixes #74745 (hopefully - the flakes are hard to reproduce)

>This issue is marked as blocking 1.14, but as this PR introduces a new feature to fix the test I think we need to wait for 1.15.

First, we want to make the security integration cleaner - sshd limits us to real users on the system and SELinux further restricts how content can be organized.  A short term solution is going to be to make authn info (keys, passwords, etc) easier to retrieve on demand from the masters (on demand because ssh is rare and we can delay access a bit).  A longer solution is to either patch sshd like GitHub did, use sssd more heavily, or drop in a separate sshd implementation like the go.ssh library.  All have drawbacks of course.

A second (parallel) step would be to move the authenticating ssh proxy part off the host, and have it handle all the details of mapping the incoming user and the ssh path (for git and others) into a valid destination, and then establish an ssh forward or other action to the remote server under a different set of credentials.  The pattern is the same (""fake"" user representing an entity, ssh key command with generated keys and a step command, but we'd be able to concentrate authn and authz decisions.  The backend servers' sshd would then deal with one or two users representing roles and tasks (gitreader, logpuller) instead of having the full set of users.  The private keys for those roles would live on the authenticating ssh proxy.  The end goal would be for the ssh user to the proxy be something like a project or namespace (auth is checked against users/keys related to that project) and then to be able to use the path to further distinguish the target of the operation (/pods/XYZ/containerName).  That also lets us control fan out of keys more tightly.

Everything in the second step is useful even without it being in a proxy (standardizing a set of tools around ssh to allow this), it's just easier to manage.

bboreham [1:06 PM]  
We are seeing issues with kubeadm installs on Centos 7 where `bridge-nf-call-iptables` is disabled. This means kube-proxy rules are not applied in all cases. Anyone else seen this?

luxas [1:43 PM]  
No, but sounds like we should check for that in `kubeadm verify` when we're creating that command

dcfsc [1:58 PM]  
We are seeing issues on a Centos 7 cluster and our setting is:
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 0
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 0
Can we flip them and restart and it'll work? (edited)

[1:58](is kubeadm installation)

marun [2:22 PM]  
so long as the cluster data config are retained it should work

dcfsc [2:38 PM]  
We flipped to
`net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 1
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1`
and DNS resolves and accessing services using DNS names works. Yay! 
So `kubeadm verify` will break in the future if these flags are not correct.  What side effects might the ""working"" settings have? (edited)

The fix:

```

The build in question had the new docker operation timeout added by @Random-Liu. Some image pulls failed with ""net/http: request canceled"", which indicated that the registry was slow to respond (> 2 minute). 
It could be that the concurrent pulling from 100 nodes overwhelmed the registry, and the e2e-scalability-minion-5448 node was just the unlucky one (?).

@wojtek-t @Random-Liu, how about we bump the timeout to 3 or even 5 minutes? It doesn't address the fundamental problem, whatever it might be, but may stop the build from failing.

sub-app framework stuff could be cleaned up - it's a little hard to
follow.  If we are not building individual binaries, it's a simpler
problem.  It should actually speed up the build, too, I think.  The same
code gets compiled incrementally but less to link.  It should probably
support argv[0] swithcing too.

standard questions when we want to tighten validation:
* does it prevent a no-op update of existing persisted objects that would fail this new validation? (would block storage migration tasks)
* does it prevent deletion of existing persisted objects with finalizers that would fail this new validation? (update is required to remove finalizers to allow deletion)
* does it prevent controllers from updating status of existing persisted objects that would fail this new validation?

we could consider ratcheting validation:
* apply this tightened validation on create
* apply this tightened validation on update where the old object passed this validation (don't let a valid object become invalid)
* skip this tightened validation on update where the old object fails this validation

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I understand the commands that are listed [here](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands?repo=kubernetes%2Fkubernetes).

In response to [this](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/75416):

>**What type of PR is this?**
>/kind bug
>
>**What this PR does / why we need it**:
>
>HTTP probes currently follow redirects, and perform the health check against the endpoint redirect to. This behavior differs from the documented behavior, which states that any HTTP response with a status code between 200 and 400 should be treated as success.
>
>As a backwards-compatibility compromise, this PR modifies the probe logic follow redirects if they go to the same hostname (e.g. a relative redirect to a different path). If the redirect points to a different hostname, then the response is simply treated as a success.
>
>**Which issue(s) this PR fixes**:
>Fixes https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/73172
>
>**Special notes for your reviewer**:
>
>**Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?**:
>```release-note
>ACTION REQUIRED: Health check (liveness & readiness) probes using an HTTPGetAction will no longer follow redirects to different hostnames from the original probe request. Instead, these non-local redirects will be treated as a Success (the documented behavior). In this case an event with reason ""ProbeWarning"" will be generated, indicating that the redirect was ignored. If you were previously relying on the redirect to run health checks against different endpoints, you will need to perform the healthcheck logic outside the Kubelet, for instance by proxying the external endpoint rather than redirecting to it.

I think the aborted upgrade test is what caused the resources to leak.  For example, here's one leaked resource:
```

```

In the job, it is used by a pod that's part of the upgrade test:

Since it is a Windows issue, we can get some help from Microsoft side.

A user may set Limit, but depending what other pods are running on the node their pod gets scheduled to, they may or may not get more CPU than indicated by the Limit?

I guess I can see the argument for making this behavior configurable, but what granularity were you think of? Per (guaranteed) pod or per cluster? This might be something a cluster admin wants to set cluster-wide (though I guess they could use an admission controller to do that if it is specified per pod...)

BTW you mentioned that the current behavior thows users off. My naive assumption would be that someone sees the word ""limit"" and assumes that their pod will be ""limited"" to using that amount of CPU. So I think the current behavior is more intuitive than the alternative. That said I definitely see the argument for making it configurable.

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I understand the commands that are listed [here](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands?repo=kubernetes%2Fkubernetes).

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

>**What this PR does / why we need it**:
>
>The CPU manager include periodic reconciliation logic that rewrites cpuset values through the CRI for every container. A majority of those writes are unnecessary. This PR changes the reconcile logic to keep track of containers that failed to reconcile, so that they can be retried in subsequent iterations.
>
>- `cpumanager.Policy` gains ability to trigger reconciliation of all containers.
>- Periodic reconcile now only retries containers that previously failed to reconcile.
>- Updated unit tests accordingly.

I have a few thoughts:

1) Normally the aws-sdk-go does a reasonable job of retries.  So the error message is surprising.  We do have a custom retry policy in the ""main"" cloudprovider, which we should use.  But it actually is primarily for logging, and actually to insert a process-wide backoff (IIRC).  The process-wide backoff is needed because otherwise rate limiting is done per call, and concurrent calls can easily exhaust limits.  Concurrent updates might be what is happening here (maybe)
2) I do wonder what the default retry policy is for ECR.  It may also have changed recently, because we updated aws-sdk-go.
3) Separately though, a 5 minute outage of ECR (as a thought experiment) shouldn't take us offline for 12 hours.  I propose we should not treat an error response as identical to the happy path.

In other words, I wonder if we should fix this as well:
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/8fd414537b5143ab039cb910590237cabf4af783/pkg/credentialprovider/provider.go#L120-L121

I don't mind the aggressive retries - though I worry that we are knowingly going to the max for 20 seconds, and this limit is AWS _account_ wide I believe.  But there will always be glitches, and so I feel the underlying problem is that it takes us 12 hours to recover, instead of a few minutes...

PS thank you so much for finding this - I think this explains so much.  And sorry that I didn't find it sooner in my email :-("	5

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I understand the commands that are listed [here](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands).

I ask because in Openshift we found this led to lazy coupling, and in scenarios where you have code that wants a unique id, you want to be able to alias names instead.  At least that couples k8s to an image via a specific resource provided by k8s, vs making the image dependent on k8s.

namespace is practically impossible.  You have to enter the target
namespace to really do it right.

I'd love to see this be possible, so it is probably worth exploring, but I
think it HAS to support atomic updates properly if updates are supported at
all.

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I understand the commands that are listed [here](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands?repo=kubernetes%2Fkubernetes).

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I understand the commands that are listed [here](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands?repo=kubernetes%2Fkubernetes).

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work.

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I understand the commands that are listed [here](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands?repo=kubernetes%2Fkubernetes).

i think it's how variables can be escaped in the Downward API.
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.6/dev_guide/downward_api.html#dapi-escaping-environment-variable-references
although escaping any `""$$""` sequence in a random string such as `""$$A$$B$$"" -> ""$A$B$""` seems a bit odd.

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I understand the commands that are listed [here](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands?repo=kubernetes%2Fkubernetes).

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work.

resources and user set resources (opaque int resources) has been a hassle
to deal with (as it introduced unexpected behavior in the device plugin lifecycle).

We should also consider a few alternatives :

- separating them from a name (/dns) perspective.

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work.

for both view and set, which can cause confusion (although is convenient
for experienced users).

I agree that we should have a simple command that changes the namespace for
the current context - it's ok for it to be namespace based.

We should think a bit about whether the verb we pick would

a. have any other things to alter for the local user (switch user, switch
cluster, switch context)
b. ever overlap with a use case we might want as a cluster action

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I understand the commands that are listed [here](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands?repo=kubernetes%2Fkubernetes).

- apiserver cpu constraint
 It increased slightly. I don't think it's a serious issue. I'm going to increase it's value (still lower then original test value).
- scheduler cpu constraint
I suspect is connected to resent scheduler changes. Parallelism inside scheduler was increased - more cpu should be used. Constraint should be adjusted.
- controller manager cpu constraint
There is already issue open for this. https://github.com/kubernetes/perf-tests/issues/326
- pod startup time
For a moment startup time increased from 4s to 16s. It looks like a real flake - it happened once. If it happens again I will investigate this case."	5	flake

I think that's a lots of commands that user needs to remember and type, if we could provide a much simply command for the new, it would be much help. Like this one:

more or less. CNI lets you do lots of things, but kubernetes mostly only implements the subset of CNI features that correspond to the functionality of pre-CNI kube network plugins.

If you're interested in implementing this yourself, then I assume people would be ok with accepting a PR for it (as long as it was cleanly implemented, etc; you'd probably want to discuss plans here or on the sig-network mailing list). Alternatively, you could submit a PR to update the documentation to be clearer about kube's CNI limitations. (I don't know exactly where in the docs this would go.)"	5	bug

I think https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/75659 and a cherry-pick to the `v1.14` branch make sense. I'd rather hold onto merging them until after we've released later today (🤞), especially for 1.14. My reasoning is that we've seen the tests stable with v0.18 of both dependencies for quite a while. Even if the changes are small, it might still be worth letting the CI run for a while if we update any dependencies.

Because the job is very quick, I feel we can still decide to go for it later today if we decide otherwise; I'll hold back for now and let's speak at today's release meeting."	0	failing-test

Self labeling only ever happened when the kubelet deleted/recreated its node object. 

That only happened in cloud provider specific situations, it was not a general mechanism things deployed on kubelets should depend on happening on upgrade. 

The self-deletion behavior was an artifact of the external ID being immutable and required for cloud provider identification. That field has been deprecated since 1.2, and as of 1.11 is no longer populated or required by the in-tree cloud providers, so the kubelet no longer self-deletes its node object. 

Additionally, GCE stabilized the external ID to be identical before/after upgrade. 

In short, delete/recreate of the Node object is not something to depend on happening on upgrade boundaries. "	5	bug

1. Run the cherry-picking script with that PR's number: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/hack/cherry_pick_pull.sh - this will create pull requests cherry-picking the fix
1. Request a regular LGTM review (requesting it from whoever LGTM'd the original pull request usually works best)
1. Request a review from the patch release manager for the series you're interested in. You can look up the relevant contacts for 1.12 [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.12/release_team.md) and for 1.11 [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.11/release_team.md).

That's it!"	5	bug

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I understand the commands that are listed [here](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands?repo=kubernetes%2Fkubernetes).

If a user specifies `replicas: 100` in their deploy manifest, runs `kubectl apply`, and then wants to migrate to HPA, then they've painted themselves into a corner.  

If they remove `replicas:` from the manifest and `apply` it, the app will immediately scale down to the default of 1 replica.  HPA will kick in, but customer experience will suffer in the meantime.  

We could avoid this if we could pause the scaling, apply the new manifest, manually `kubectl scale` to 100, and then unpause."	5	feature

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

We are trying to consolidate the channels to which questions for help/support are posted so that we can improve our efficiency in responding to your requests, and to make it easier for you to find answers to frequently asked questions and how to address common use cases.

We regularly see messages posted in multiple forums, with the full response thread only in one place or, worse, spread across multiple forums. Also, the large volume of support issues on github is making it difficult for us to use issues to identify real bugs.

The Kubernetes team scans stackoverflow on a regular basis, and will try to ensure your questions don't go unanswered.

Before posting a new question, please search stackoverflow for answers to similar questions, and also familiarize yourself with:
- [the user guide](http://kubernetes.io/v1.1/)
- [the troubleshooting guide](http://kubernetes.io/v1.1/docs/troubleshooting.html)

Again, thanks for using Kubernetes.

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I understand the commands that are listed [here](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands?repo=kubernetes%2Fkubernetes).

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I understand the commands that are listed [here](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands?repo=kubernetes%2Fkubernetes).

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

>If the matter is security related, please disclose it privately via https://kubernetes.io/security/

>
>
>**What happened**:
>
>Inspecting the certificates that were installed for a Kubernetes 1.13 cluster by kubeadm revealed several discrepancies to the current documentation in [""PKI Certificates and Requirements""](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/certificates/) with respect to actual vs. documented certificates.
>
>**What you expected to happen**:
>
>I expected an exact match with the documentation. When certificates expire
>and one has to recreate them manually exact information is key.
>
>**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:
>
>for file-based certificates:  `openssl x509 -in <crt> -noout -text`
>for kubeconfig-based certificates: `echo <certificate-data> | base64 -d | openssl x509 -noout -text`

With https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/7824, we enabled running heapster and metric server in our scalability tests (for 2k and 5k node clusters).

After that change, the number of ""LIST nodes"" calls increased.
I looked deeper into the metrics and basically:
- up until run 142, there were 0 calls coming from pod-nanny
- from run 145, there is a number (in 145 - 360 of those) calls from pod-nanny

Pretty much all of these calls are really long, so they are clearly the reason for that regression.

That said, I looked even deeper into it. Interestingly pod-nanny is listing nodes from cache, so it's surprising why they are so long. 

So I looked into currently running test and the reason is the following;

- [BTW - there are 2 pod nannies, one for heapster and one for metrics-server]
- both pod nannies has CPU-limit set:
  - metric server: 100m cpu limit:
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/cluster/addons/metrics-server/metrics-server-deployment.yaml#L63
  - heapster: 50m cpu limit:
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/cluster/addons/cluster-monitoring/standalone/heapster-controller.yaml#L65

Looking into usage, both these container are fully saturated all the time.

So to summarize, the reason for regression is:
- pod-nannies have cpu-limits
- those limits are too low (for large clusters)
- they are cpu-starved
- as a result, they are not able to quickly process/read data that apiserver is sending - that's why the requests take so long"	2	bug

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I understand the commands that are listed [here](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands?repo=kubernetes%2Fkubernetes).

call DELETE /pods/foo, I should be able to immediately create a new pod
named foo.

So either we need a STOP verb that is different than DELETE, or we need
DELETE to move a resource to a new collection (pods -> exPods?) for later
GC.

In response to [this](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/68201):

>`hack/verify-import-boss.sh` is a tool we use to reduce technical debt around rampant interdepencies between packages in the main k/k repository.
>
>The tool uses a file `.import-restrictions` in some directories that verify-import-boss.sh then uses to check. The syntax for the file is here:
>https://github.com/kubernetes/code-generator/blob/master/cmd/import-boss/main.go#L32-L52
>
>We currently have the following `.import-restrictions` in the main k/k repository:
>```
>[dims@dims-mac 19:00] ~/go/src/k8s.io/kubernetes ⟩ find  . -name .import-res*
>./cmd/kubeadm/.import-restrictions
>./pkg/.import-restrictions
>./pkg/api/testing/.import-restrictions
>./pkg/client/clientset_generated/.import-restrictions
>./pkg/controller/.import-restrictions
>./pkg/kubectl/.import-restrictions
>./pkg/kubemark/.import-restrictions
>./pkg/printers/.import-restrictions
>./pkg/printers/internalversion/.import-restrictions
>./staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/.import-restrictions
>./staging/src/k8s.io/code-generator/cmd/lister-gen/.import-restrictions
>```
>What needs to be done?
>- Open up the `.import-restrictions` file, check if `AllowedPrefixes` under different `Rules` are correct. 
>  - The packages listed are still being used in the code under the pacakge
>  - If there are outside packages that are used, but not listed under `AllowedPrefixes` then add those packages
>- Possibly add new .import-restrictions for different directories under `/staging/src/k8s.io/` so we can be sure each directory under that is self-contained.
>- If the .import-restrictions looks correct, then leave a comment in this issue so others don't duplicate the work. If you want to work on a specific file, leave a note so others don't spend their time on the same work.

The problem is now that kubernetes assumes that openstack works correctly. If volume is attached to node x when pod tries to start in node y, the controller raises volume danglingerror https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/cloudprovider/providers/openstack/openstack_volumes.go#L348 which means that it should detach the volume soon from incorrect node. It might take few minutes, but it will do it (if openstack works behind the scene).

imo this is not bug, this is not just openstack feature - it is how core controllers work in kubernetes.  Kubernetes does not wait volume detach before moving pods between nodes

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I understand the commands that are listed [here](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands?repo=kubernetes%2Fkubernetes).

I think I understand what the problem is. The event sequence for this race condition is
0. Pod is running and the volumes are already mounted.
1. kubelet restarts and receives a pod.
2. the volumes of the pod is added to the desired state.
3. reconciler first tries to verify volume is attached (this might takes a little time because it waits until VolumeInUse is updated in the node status).
4. Pod is being deleted (because kubelet is down for 5 minutes, pod is evicted). Remove the volume from desired state (there is a check in desired state populator to make sure volume exists in actual state already. This check can pass because volume is already added in actual state from step 3)
5. Reconciler only try to detach volume because there is no record of volume mounts (but in reality the volume is mounted too).

So the main problem is that actual state does not know volume is actually mounted and will not try to trigger unmount at all.

One possible solution is when kubelet calls cleanupOrphanedPodDirs, this function can go ahead to unmount and delete volume directories.

I'm not 100% sure that the place for this is directly in the existing golint script:
- Will the output always be in the same format as golint?
- Would the failures list apply in the same way? Do we even want to provide a mechanism to ignore conformance lints?
- It's a bit disingenuous as it's not actually golint failing, it's our own linter.

> Do you check HasSynced() in non-test code to ensure the initial list/watch has completed prior to making use of the store? If so, what does that do if the CRD is not installed?

I don't check `HasSynced()` in the volume plugin code, because the CRD does not need to be installed at that time. The plugin behavior is the same for ""CRD not installed"" and ""CRD installed, but CR does not exist"" cases.

The case ""CRD installed, CR created, but HasSynced is false"" is the same as ""CRD installed, CR created, HasSynced is true, but CR did not reach the cache yet because it was created after the cache has been synced"".

Long story: when CRD is not installed, `factory.Start()` tries to `List` and `Watch` the non-existing CRD and it fails. The informer factory re-tries that every 1-2 seconds, so eventually it starts working when the CRD is installed. Until then, the informer cache is empty (""no CR exists"") and the CSI volume plugin falls back to original behavior (all volumes are attachable).

So, in the worst case, a pod with CSI volume is being started and CRD + CR is not installed yet. CSI volume plugin goes through the ""attaching"" path and tries to attach the volume by creating VolumeAttachment instance. There is no external attacher processing that, from A/D and kubelet point of view the volume is ""being attached"". `Attach()` times out and A/D controller re-tries it with exp. backoff.

Now, CRD is installed + CR is created and it's stored in the informer cache. Subsequent `Attach()` will succeed because it checks the informer cache and skips attach completely and kubelet will mount the volume.

You can notice that `VolumeAttachment` is not deleted. It will be deleted in `Detach()`. Maybe it could be deleted when `Attach()` skips attachment...

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

But I didn't have the problem on my Docker Desktop setup (MacOS, Docker Desktop, k8s v1.13.0).

Minikube is using coredns instead of kube-dns.
I listed the pods in the `kube-system` namespace and had a look on the logs of a coredns pod:

I tried to patch the deployment as described here -> no success

I found this issue in the minikube project, which sounds similar:

<details>

In response to [this](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/76797):

>The `rest.AnonymousClientConfig()` method return a copy of the provided config, with credentials removed (bearer token, username/password, and client certificate/key data).
>
>In the following versions, `rest.AnonymousClientConfig()` did not effectively clear service account credentials loaded using `rest.InClusterConfig()`:
>* v1.12.0-v1.12.4
>* v1.13.0
>
>**What is the impact?**
>* `k8s.io/client-go` users that use the `rest.AnonymousClientConfig()` method directly with client config loaded with `rest.InClusterConfig()` receive back a client config which can still send the loaded service account token with requests.
>
>**How was the issue fixed?**
>* In 1.12.5+ and 1.13.1+, `rest.InClusterConfig()` was modified to return a client config that is safe to use with the `rest.AnonymousClientConfig()` method (https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/71713)
>* In v1.15.0, the `rest.AnonymousClientConfig()` will also exclude the `config.Transport` and `config.WrapTransport` fields, in addition to the explicit credential-carrying fields. (https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/75771)
>
>**How do I resolve the issue?**
>* Upgrade `k8s.io/client-go` to `kubernetes-1.12.5`, `kubernetes-1.13.1`, `kubernetes-1.14.0`, or higher
>* or manually clear the `config.WrapTransport` and `config.Transport` fields in addition to calling `rest.AnonymousClientConfig()`
>
>Thanks to Oleg Bulatov for reporting this issue.

It is a very common scenario that the scheduler should be able to handle well. It is surprising that it doesn't work for you. In fact we have numerous tests that verify this behavior. Can you share more spec about the node and pod configuration? For example, it would be great if you could run `kubectl describe pod ...` or `kubectl describe node ...` and send us the results.	5	bug

Definitely, unfortunately, this is a bug :(

UPDATE: @KomorkinMikhail on the other hand, from connection management perspective SCTP is rather similar to TCP than UDP. I.e. SCTP has the construct of a ""connection"" (association). So, I wonder, if  the endpoint state based conntrack cleanup logic exists only for UDP in k8s (as it is now), what is the situation with TCP connections then?
I can see in the k8s code, that TCP related conntrack timeouts can be configured via kube-proxy configuration, i.e. small timeout values can be set. Somehow I have the feeling that if we want to enhance SCTP related conntrack management better than now, then we should rather implement the configuration option for SCTP related timeout values, too.
Or is it so, that also TCP related conntrack management should be enhanced with an endpoint state based logic?"	5	bug

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I understand the commands that are listed [here](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands).

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I understand the commands that are listed [here](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands?repo=kubernetes%2Fkubernetes).

hi, did you upgrade from 1.11 -> 1.12 -> 1.13 -> 1.14?
direct upgrades from 1.11 to 1.14 are not supported by the project.

also please read the changelog for 1.14:
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/7a47bc3d1d5e4859dced35b1217163e061a03329/CHANGELOG-1.14.md#deprecations

```
The following features are now GA, and the associated feature gates are deprecated and will be removed in v1.15:

CustomPodDNS
HugePages
MountPropagation
PersistentLocalVolumes
```

so you have to remove them.

I would imagine the most common way to implement a webhook authorizer will be as a pod running in the cluster. The configuration mechanism for the webhook authorizer should enable that use case.

Alternatively, removing it and telling people to use admission controller webhook is also reasonable (assuming it solves this problem, which I take from point 2 that it does), but then we need to make the admission controller webhook receive all requests including reads, which IIUC it does not today.

/cc @ericchiang 
/cc @kubernetes/sig-auth-misc for visibility (I assume it would be implemented by SIG api machinery)

(I'm assuming ""zones"" are separate failure domains with inter-zone network latency higher than intra-zone.) Keeping clusters autonomous, with all their management components (master components) in the same failure domain and connected by a low-latency network, seems desirable. This is also useful from a software factoring standpoint (we can keep the core Kubernetes code simpler). I think the Kubernetes API is fairly composable, so building something on top could be feasible.

This label is tied to Ubernetes Lite which is not a discrete API resource, hence no applicable  `--runtime-config` flag to enable/disable it.

@bgrant0607 any thoughts on this? It seems to me that some alpha labels/annotations will be directly tied to specific features that have API resources (e.g. a special label/annotation that is consumed by a new alpha-level controller) while others will not. But in both cases it seems not trivial to have `--runtime-config` control whether it is published.

Some minor comments:
1. Service controller comprises two major parts (see docs/design/federated-service.md for details):
   1. Delegating service creation to underlying Kubernetes clusters.
   2. Creating load balancing apparatus across the top of the resulting Kubernetes services. 
2. I think that we can leave the HA items until all the other stuff is working.

About CloudProvider: 
In k8s the cloud provider info is loaded from configure file, in federation, as we are handling multiple clusters, cloud providers for each cluster might be different, is there a way to retrieve the cloud provider info outside the actual cluster? I did not see such code, maybe we need to add that. 
An alternative is in current phase we do not support heterogeneous federation, by that way we still can load provide from config file as is.
About Authentication:
If the unsecure port of the cluster is disabled, how controller manager could talk to k8s clusters?

The old godep license process was several times slower than this and required hand-maintaining an exclusion list.  The artifact from that was simply a list of licenses and this new version gathers actual license content dynamically across all packages and does it several times faster.

I commented in the other issue.  What is the repro case here for the failure?

+ echo 'Using published version ci/v1.3.0-beta.0 (from ci/latest)'

Using published version ci/v1.3.0-beta.0 (from ci/latest)
Pulling binaries from GCS; using server version ci/v1.3.0-beta.0.
```

This is from the latest federation-e2e logs. The latest run of federation-build produced this version string:

``` sh
 v1.3.0-alpha.5.396_5d8710196be7c5
```

Root cause of error: federation-e2e job is pulling tarballs that weren't build by federation-build.

Pulling in tarballs built by the regular kubernetes build job (not the federated one), would produce the line: 17 yaml error your seeing, as `federated-image.tag` file will not be there.

I think we should just make federation-build and federation-e2e jobs agree that the latest ci build version should be in `gs://kubernetes-release/ci/latest-federation.txt` or something along those lines.

Lets hold off merging this until we've found the root cause though.  @mml mentioned that he'd tacked this down to one of the other AfterEach clauses setting the client to nil, leading to this nil pointer panic.

Surely you want rrstype.AAAA here, not rrstype.CNAME?

"Does this mean that in the future we cannot have local cluster Ingress names resolve back to their public address (since the federation part will be in the same scope as namespace and thus prevent us adding it)?  I.e. we will now never be able to do something like `foo.bar.ing.cluster.local` because `bar` is ambiguous (for petset names).

Should we not make this about federated ingress explicitly via the dns scope?

EDIT: like ""ingfed.cluster.local""

Do the nodes in the zones have roughly equal free capacity etc?  Otherwise the scheduler might consider it more important not to overload a particular node, vs spreading the load.  Consider the case that you have one node in an AZ, and 10 in another: you don't really want to overload that one node.  Nor do you want to _not_ run pods simply because they don't fit on that one node, when there is plenty of capacity in another zone.

Note though that if you use volumes (on AWS or GCE), they will force the zone allocation.  If you use PetSets also, dynamic volumes will be spread across zones, and thus a PetSet is (informally) always going to spread across your zones.

For updates of cluster Ingresses, the UID of the federated ingress, rather than the cluster ingress is  being used.  This is not correct.  Our fake test framework is not as strict as the real Kubernetes API about checking UID's on updates, so it didn't pick this up.

I'll send a PR to fix shortly.

I think it is failing because the persistent volume admission controller is not enabled in GKE.  This admission controller tags statically created PVs with zone labels so that the scheduler will only assign pods to the same zone as the PV.

I previously tried enabling it in GKE in 1.6, but it was hitting some permissions issue, but I can work on it for 1.7.

@David Oppenheimer
My understanding is that what's wanted here is ""considered all nodes and it
can't schedule onto any of them""? We do surface that in PodStatus today in
PodReasonUnschedulable. In terms of how the federated job controller can
make use of this information without having to track each pod, I think the
missing piece is https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/32863.
Once that's implemented, this kind of information should be surfaced in the
JobStatus, so the federated job controller only needs to watch the
per-cluster Jobs, which IIUC it is doing anyway. Until
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/32863 is implemented, I
think you would just have to periodically fetch the list of pending pods
from the underlying cluster, extract the ones that are unschedulable (by
examining PodReasonUnschedulable), find which of them were created by a
local instance of a federated Job, and then take action based on that.

@quinton-hoole 
I think a possibly sensible approach here might be to start by creating Jobs in the underlying clusters with only a single worker, and incrementally scaling them up (possibly one worker at a time) only once it has been demonstrated that workers are able to schedule in that cluster. That way, workers will be allocated to the clusters where they are actually able to schedule. Cluster-level Jobs that end up with a single pending pod will remain in that state (approximately) until either additional capacity becomes available, or the required workers are successfully scheduled into other clusters.

Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should join the org to skip this step.

I understand the commands that are listed [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/master/commands.md).

The way you would fix the provider code is by making sure that the following return an empty list rather than an error when not found:

https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/federation/pkg/dnsprovider/providers/google/clouddns/zones.go#L32

https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/federation/pkg/dnsprovider/providers/aws/route53/zones.go#L33

https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/federation/pkg/dnsprovider/providers/coredns/zones.go#L32

And update the documentation for provider.Zones.List() accordingly.

By the way, I'm not sure that your current code will work correctly on all providers, as it's not guaranteed that they will all return the error type and code you are assuming in this PR's code.

It might be safer to fix each of the providers, to make sure they all return the right result (i.e. empty set and no error if the result set is empty).  The current API definition (provider.Zones) is not specific enough to be able to assume that you'll receive a errors.APIStatus type back from dnsprovider.Zones.List().

I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

Checkout [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/api/types.go#L1237).

it seems I understand your issue. I have the same question before, but there is an answer actually in your situation.

To brief your case, you have a configmap(`settings.json: blahblah`), and want to mount into a folder `/app`. Then below is what you need to know:

1.  Once you mount a volume(no matter it is configmap or others), it overrides the `mountPath`, so in your case, the `/app` folder will only contain `settings.json`.
1.  I know it is not what you expected, so you have to specify the `mountPath: /app/settings.json`, only that way, the original content in `/app` folders won't be affected.
1.  well, when you do the second step, you remember that configmap is actually a list of key-value pairs, you only need one of the keys(though you actually have only one as well), so you need to tell the volume mounts to use a subpath from you configmap.

This is something that you will get eventually:

```yaml
containers:
- volumeMounts:
  - name: demo-config
    mountPath: /app/settings.json
    subPath: settings.json
volumes:
- name: demo-config
  configMap:
    name: demo
```"	5

When just running 10 pods (scaled down the env to see if it was a pure init bug)

Issue does not occur on Ubuntu-1604-lts
(But due to docker 18.x PLEG issues with Ubuntu-1604-lts we really need the upgrade to a higher Ubuntu version, so this is iptables issue is pretty critical to get resolved)

Reproducing the issue can be troublesome: A restart of kube-proxy did not reveal the issue again (so slightly different behavior compared to shahaf600 notes). The issue seems to be more prevalent on system boot.

Result of the issue is failure of kube-dns capabilities to resolve external domain names, and random application failures due to that."	5	bug
